You will practice defining variables, performing calculations, and displaying results using print() statements.

It definitely helped me to set up Python from scratch, because it's been a while since I've used it. I feel like Python is fairly straightforward and easy to learn (and it helps that I've coded with it before). I do feel like the code is clunkier than it could be, but I don't really see the need to make this code super efficient right now. As a bit of a challenge, I decided to make the code take a user input for the meal cost and tip percentage (but I didn't do any user validation for it as of yet - we'll just pretend/assume the user is smart and isn't trying to break the program).
